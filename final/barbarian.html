					<h4> DTC is a product that promotes employees to form a healthy habit around sustainability by being conscious of plastic usage in the office. Users can see a relatable impact that they make by using less plastic, and can also see how they’re doing compared to their co-workers. </h4>

				<h1> <strong> Research </strong> </h1>
				<br>
				<p> I joined this project after the primary research and initial wireframes had already been done. The premise of this project was to promote a sustainable lifestyle within the office by motivating the employees to use metal utensils instead of plastic utensils. There would be a tablet placed in the office kitchen, and every time an employee uses a metal utensil, they would tap on the screen. The image below shows initial screens that had been made before I joined. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="problem">
				<h1> <strong> Problem - pt.1 </strong> </h1>
				<br>
				<blockquote>
					<p class="thick"> People are not interested in the product because they don’t know the significance of the interaction.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<br>
				<p> To figure out how the people around the office would be interested in interacting with the product, I conducted semi-structured interviews with some of the employees and noticed that most people said they would be interested, as long as the app itself had value and <strong> didn’t take too much of their time. </strong> </p>
				<br>
			</div>
			<div class="ideation">
				<h1> <strong> Ideation </strong> </h1>
				<br>
				<ol>
					<li class="thick"> How might we initially attract people to use our product? </li>
					<li class="thick">  How might we incentivize people to choose an action that benefits the environment over the convenience of plastic products? </li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<p> I came up with including the following behaviors on the app to capture the oppotunity space that I’ve identified: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>  Rewarding good behavior (social recognition, showing direct impact) </li>
					<li> Emphasizing consequences of plastic usage </li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<p>Rewarding good behavior will help users initially be attracted to the product, and emphasizing consequences of plastic usage will help users understand the significance of their action, thus leading the users to be conscious of the impact their actions have and ultimately form a habit.</p>
				
				<p>Features that we deemed appropriate as “rewards” for this product were:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Connecting the numbers to digestable and relatable facts (i.e. recycling one glass bottle can power a computer for 30 minutes).</li>
					<li>A fun microinteraction of ‘flinging’ the utensils instead of just a tap</li>
					<li>A big moment of acknowledgement for reaching a certain number</li>
				</ul>
				<br>

				<p>I translated these ideas into a low-fi prototype. I stripped down the colors that the previous MVP had in order to focus on the flow and content of the screens:</p>
		</div>
		<div id="loader-wrapper">
			<div class="lds-heart"><div>
		</div>
		<script>
			var myVar; 
			function myFunction() {
				myVar = setTimeout(showPage, 1000);
			}
			function showPage() {
				document.getElementById("loader-wrapper").style.display = "none";
				document.getElementByClass("lds-heart").style.display="block";
			}
		</script>
