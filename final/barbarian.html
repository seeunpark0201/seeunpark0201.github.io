				<h1> <strong> Research </strong> </h1>
				<br>
				<p> I joined this project after the primary research and initial wireframes had already been done. The premise of this project was to promote a sustainable lifestyle within the office by motivating the employees to use metal utensils instead of plastic utensils. There would be a tablet placed in the office kitchen, and every time an employee uses a metal utensil, they would tap on the screen. The image below shows initial screens that had been made before I joined. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="problem">
				<h1> <strong> Problem - pt.1 </strong> </h1>
				<br>
				<blockquote>
					<p class="thick"> People are not interested in the product because they don’t know the significance of the interaction.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<br>
				<p> To figure out how the people around the office would be interested in interacting with the product, I conducted semi-structured interviews with some of the employees and noticed that most people said they would be interested, as long as the app itself had value and <strong> didn’t take too much of their time. </strong> </p>
				<br>
			</div>
			<div class="ideation">
				<h1> <strong> Ideation </strong> </h1>
				<br>
				<ol>
					<li class="thick"> How might we initially attract people to use our product? </li>
					<br>
					<li class="thick">  How might we incentivize people to choose an action that benefits the environment over the convenience of plastic products? </li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<p> I came up with including the following behaviors on the app to capture the oppotunity space that I’ve identified: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>  Rewarding good behavior (social recognition, showing direct impact) </li>
					<li> Emphasizing consequences of plastic usage </li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<p>Rewarding good behavior will help users initially be attracted to the product, and emphasizing consequences of plastic usage will help users understand the significance of their action, thus leading the users to be conscious of the impact their actions have and ultimately form a habit.</p>
				
				<p>Features that we deemed appropriate as “rewards” for this product were:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Connecting the numbers to digestable and relatable facts (i.e. recycling one glass bottle can power a computer for 30 minutes).</li>
					<li>A fun microinteraction of ‘flinging’ the utensils instead of just a tap</li>
					<li>A big moment of acknowledgement for reaching a certain number</li>
				</ul>
				<br>

				<p>I translated these ideas into a low-fi prototype. I stripped down the colors that the previous MVP had in order to focus on the flow and content of the screens:</p> <br>

				<h1> <strong> Usability Testing </strong> </h1>
				<br>
				<h2> <mark> Insights: </mark> </h2>
				<br>
				<ol>
					<li class="thick"> People want to know more global impacts that they’re making by reducing plastic waste.
					</li>
					<br>
					<li class="thick"> Interested in personalized data reports - “How much impact did I make the past month? </li>
					<br>
					<li class="thick"> People want some competition. </li>
					<br>
				</ol>
				<p> We conducted usability tests on 9 employees on the prototype above. With the help of my manager, I wrote a script that focused on finding out improvements to make: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>How well do the users interact with the app in the way it was designed to?</li>
					<li> How do users react to the reward?</li>
					<li>How interesting is the product - does it succeed in making users wanting to find out more?</li>
					<br>
				</ul>		
			</div>
			<div class="problem">
				<h1> <strong> Problem - pt.2 </strong> </h1>
				<br>
				<p> In doing the research and ideating, a question popped into my head: </p>
				<blockquote>
					<p class="thick"> How can we make the app ubiquitous such that users can keep track of the impact their actions have in their everyday lives - outside of the office?
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<br>
				<p> I realized that this product would have so much more potential if it lived as a mobile app, as phones have become such an integral part of our lives. After proposing the idea to my manager, we agreed to think about an ecosystem for this product to live outside of the office kichen. </p>
				<br>
				<h2> <mark> Competitive Analysis </mark></h2>
				<p> In order to better understand what kind of products exist that keep track of a certain action, I found and analyzed 6 different apps - 3 of them were calorie counters, and the other 3 counted carbon footprints. The main takeaways were: </p>
				<ol>
					<li class="thick"> The act of logging a certain action helps people be more conscious of that behavior and in turn empower them to control it.
					</li>
					<br>
					<li class="thick"> Currently there are no apps that track plastic usage and convert it to a relatable fact easily understood by users.</li>
					<br>
				</ol>				
			</div>	
			<div class="ideation">
				<p>From all of the research findings, I identified two specific problem spaces: </p>
				<ol>
					<li class="thick"> How might we motivate users to continue the act of reducing plastic waste in their everyday lives with our product?
					</li>
					<br>
					<li class="thick"> How might we help users easily understand the impact they are making? </li>
					<br>
				</ol>			
				<p>Here are wireframes that reflect the problem space:</p>
				<br>

			<div class="final">
				<h1> <strong> Final Design </strong> </h1>
				<br>
				<p>The mobile app is synced to the tablet app in the office, through which users can see how their team (their office) has been doing on reducing plastic waste altogether. Users can also get competitive if they wish to beause the app shows the ranking of who has been most dilient in being green.</p>

				<h1> <strong> Reflection </strong> </h1>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Thanks to our cross-functional team,  I learned to communicate with product managers, developers, graphic designers, and creative directors to work towards a common goal.</li>
					<br>
					<li> Take credit for the work you did! In the beginning of my internship, when we had meetings with the entire team, I was hesitant to share all of the work I’ve done because not all of the work were things that was explicitly asked of me to do. However, my manager, Su, encouraged me to stand up for the work I’ve done and to never be afraid of feedback. Towards the middle and end of the internship, I was confident in sharing my work, and humble in receiving feedback and criticism.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Don’t stop at what’s only required of you to do. When you have a good idea, go for it! </li>
					<br>
					<li>Earth is really dying. I read A LOT of articles and research papers about the effects of plastic on earth, global warming, climate change, etc., and we need every conscious effort to have a sustainable lifestyle in order to delay the end of life as we know it.</li>
					<br>
				</ul>
				<p>Special shoutout to Su for all the guidance and support she’s given me throughout my internship.</p>
