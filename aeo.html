				<h1> <strong> Problem </strong> </h1>
				<br>
				<blockquote>
					<p class="thick"> There is a lack of in-store personalization
				</blockquote>
				<br>
				<p> Representatives from American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) came to our class and requested a new service that would improve one of the following areas: </p>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li> Associate Enablement </li>
					<li> Return and Exchanges </li>
					<li> In-store Personalization </li>
					<li> Omni-Channel Fulfillment </li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<p> Our team started out by mapping out different ideas for each of the areas. </p>
				<br>
				<!-- image of brainstorming --> 
				<img src="assets/images/aeo-research.jpg" alt="problem area mapping" class="img-responsive" id="aeo-research">
				<br>
				<p> After discussing each of the problem areas and generating more ideas based on the mapping, we decided that we wanted to focus in on the problem of the lack of <strong> in-store personalization. </strong> </p> 
			</div>
			<div class="research">
				<h1> <strong> Primary Research </strong> </h1>
				<br>
				<p> We collected data through in-store observation, surveys, and interviews. The following insights are what we derived through each research method: </p>
				<br>
				<p> <em> In-store observation </em> </p>
				<ul>
					<li> AEO employees have access to style training but only some are designated stylists and largely work in the fitting rooms assisting customers </li>
					<li> Mannequins are currently styled according to guidelines from AEO corporate </li>
				</ul>
				<p> <em> Survey </em> </p>
				<ul>
					<li> People think in-store shopping is fun but also time-consuming and overwhelming </li>
					<li> People say they don't want style advice from associates but say they need styling help </li>
				</ul>
				<p> <em> Interviews </em> </p>
				<ul>
					<li> How clothes are displayed in stores impact customers' shopping experience </li>
				</ul>
				<br>	
				<h1> <strong> Secondary Research </strong> </h1>

				<p> Our team started out by mapping out different ideas for each of the areas. </p>
				<br>
				<img src="assets/images/aeo-research.jpg" alt="problem area mapping" class="img-responsive" id="aeo-research">
				<br>
				<p> After discussing each of the problem areas and generating more ideas based on the mapping, we decided that we wanted to focus in on the problem of the lack of <strong> in-store personalization. </strong> </p> 
			</div>
			<div class="ideation">
				<h1> <strong> Ideation </strong> </h1>
				<br>
				<p> From all of our research findings, we identified two specific <strong> problem spaces </strong> : </p>
				<ol>
					<li class="thick"> Lack of customer retention </li>
					<br>
					<li class="thick">  Customers dislike speaking to in-store associates but feel the need for styling advice </li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<p> <em> Persona </em> </p>
					<img src="assets/images/persona.png" alt="persona" class="img-responsive" id="persona">
				<br>
				<p> We narrowed down the scope of the problem area to focusing on the <strong> paradox of styling shoppers. </strong> For our target audience, we decided to focus in on store associates and people currently developing fashion style. The following is the evidence from our survey results supporting our decision: </p>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li> 47.8% of the shoppers aged 15-24 need style recommendations or suggestions </li>
					<li> 78.3% shoppers aged 15-24 prefer not to talk to associates for style recommendations and suggestions </li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<p>We identified an opportunity in bridging the gap between the above results and resolving the paradox.</p>
				<br>
				<p> During the research phase, one of the ideas that was discussed for better in-store personalization was integrating the pre-existing AE app with the in-store experience by <strong> offering a socially supported shopping experience and providing incentives for participation in a styling ecosystem that feeds into the in-store mannequin displays </strong> and also provides valuable information to AEO.  We revisited this idea and decided to flesh this out in more detail. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="co-creation">
				<h1> <strong> Co-creation of Value </strong> </h1>
				<br>
				<blockquote>
					<p class="thick"> Customers that recommend outfits have a chance to earn points/prizes through the AEO application while providing sample outfits for AEO to utilize to incentivize more purchases. <br> <br>

					These bundles will ideally increase customer confidence while crystalizing AEO in customers’ style identities. </p>
				</blockquote>
				<br>
				<p> Additionally, as the customers purchase recommended bundles, they are given discounts that will reward them for buying more. <br> 

				This will make them more loyal to the brand and more likely to purchase more from AEO. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="design-direction">
				<h1> <strong> Design Directions </strong> </h1>
				<br>
				<p> When we presented our initial innovation concept to our clients, we got a largely positive feedback. From there, we asked the following how might we questions to guide our design: </p>
				<br>
				<ol>
					<li class="thick"> How might we style unsure customers? </li>
					<br> 
					<li class="thick"> How might we build customer trust in sales associates? </li>
					<li class="thick"> How might we personalize the in-store experiences?</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<p> We conducted speed dating with the following storyboards to consolidate our design direction. </p>
				<br>
				<p> <em> Storyboards </em> </p>
				<img src="assets/images/sb1.jpg" alt="storyboard 1" class="img-responsive" id="sb1">
				<p> Idea 1: Associates prepare personalized outfits through customers' shopping data </p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<img src="assets/images/sb2.png" alt="storyboard 2" class="img-responsive" id="sb2">
				<p> Idea 2: Outfits on mannequins styled by AEO shoppers </p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<img src="assets/images/sb3.png" alt="storyboard 3" class="img-responsive" id="sb3">
				<p> Idea 3: Tag system that suggests matching outfits and provides discounts </p>
				<br>
				<p> <strong> Speed Dating Results </strong> </p>
				<ul> 
					<li> Personal styling by in-store sales associates sounds appealing, but wasn’t likely something that shoppers felt they would take advantage of </li>
					<li> Customers are “creeped out” by the idea of a store anticipating their needs by prepping clothes for shopping without the customer expressly opting in (through app or otherwise) </li>
					<li> Customers care deeply about perceived value, both in terms of dollars spent and with regard to the versatility of purchased apparel </li>
					<li> Customers are not yet in the habit of using their smartphones to use retailers’ apps while shopping for clothing </li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<p> Based on these results, we consolidated a concept that we named Trend Tagger: <br> 

				<strong> a social shopping experience that would involve AE customers in the co-creation of value by inviting them to style upcoming trends, incorporating social voting and rewards, and bundling merchandise in-store. </strong> </p>
			</div> 
			<div class="usability-testing">
				<h1> <strong> Usability Testing </strong> </h1>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> Trend Tagger is a concept that bridges digital and in-store shopping experiences, and thus it was important for us to test both components through eser enactments for physical shopping experience and online styling experience with rough prototypes. <br> 
				We focused on the following questions for user enactments:
				</p> 
				<ul>
					<li> How will shoppers respond to bundle deals? </li>
					<li> What level of information is most effective for communicating value? For transferring knowledge of program?</li>
					<li>To what degree will shoppers be interested in particiapting in Trend Tagger as stylists?</li>
					<br>
				</ul>	
				<img src="assets/images/instore.png" alt="in-store prototype" class="img-responsive" id="instore">	
				<br>
				<p> For the paper prototypes, we focused on the following questions: </p>
				<ul>
					<li> How interested will shoppers be in this concept? </li>
					<li> How might shoppers share their styles with their social networks to garner votes? </li>
					<li> What recognition might shoppers want if their styles win? </li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<img src="assets/images/flow.png" alt="paper prototype" class="img-responsive" id="flow">
				<br>
				<h2> <mark> Insights </mark> </h2>
				<ul>
					<li> Seeing an item styled with one other item feels limiting; bundling together more items would give the customer more freedom and affirmation, while still receiving a discount </li>
					<li> Recognition of customer styling should focus on how an in-store customer can become someone whos styles the clothing that is displayed in-store </li>
					<li> Rewards of participation in the Trend Tagger should be made explicit and visible to incentivize participation in the program </li>

				<h2> <mark> Challenge </mark> </h2>
				<p> How might American Eagle Outfitters bridge its digital experience with its in-store shopping experience? </p>
				<br>
				<h2> <mark> Our Solution </mark> </h2>

				<br>
				<p> Through this service, customers receive AEO’s existing loyalty program (AEO Connected) when they submit an outfit that they styled for community voting. The top three customers whose styled outfits receive the most votes win the styled merchandise as a reward.  <br> <br>

				In-store, the outfits of the winning styles are displayed with recogntion to the customer stylists. Along with the outfits, a sign of the Trend Tagger are displayed, and individual items from the outfits have a tag of the Trend Tagger to show that when it’s purchased in a bundle with the matching tag, the outfit will be discounted. <br> <br> 

				Trend Tagger yields greater in-store wallet share for American Eagle by <strong> incentivizing customers </strong> to purchase different items, <strong> rich customer data </strong> through new AEO Connected sign-ups and co-created styles, and <strong> greater confidence for customers </strong> from socially-affirming styling.  <br>

				<h1> <strong> Reflection </strong> </h1>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>This was the first HCI course I took and I learned how similar yet different the research methods of a human-centered design and psychology studies are. </li>
					<br>
					<li> When it comes to brainstorming, it’s quantity over quality! I learned the importance of generating as many ideas as possible, because you never know which one might end up being good.</li>
